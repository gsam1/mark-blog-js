# Things I have created for Free-Code-Camp

I have been working through Free-Code-Camp's curriculum and I am just finishing up the Front-End Certification. I mostly consider myself a back-end guy, thus my designs are (well at least in my eyes) awful, but at least the functionality is there. I have a lot to improve upon though (not only on the aesthetics part).

Here are a few samples:
- [Ugly Tic-Tac-Toe](https://codepen.io/fury1/full/BWdrzY/), which I plan to keep ugly, but will provide a good platform for playing around with Neural Nets.
- [A slightly better Pomodoro Timer](https://codepen.io/fury1/full/xRJGWq/). Hey I was inspired.
- [A list of Twitch streams](https://codepen.io/fury1/full/amNzgV). Still ugly. But it works.
- [A weather App](https://codepen.io/fury1/pen/kkWXba?editors=1010) which doesn't work because of the geolocation json is over http, and we don't want that right?
- [A silly JS calculator](https://codepen.io/fury1/full/aBEbOb/), which is never finished.
- [Space Marine Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/fury1/full/YGPgRj/) from Warhammer 40k.
